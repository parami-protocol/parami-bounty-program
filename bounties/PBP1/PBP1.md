## 1.  Summary

Rococo is the testnet for parachains. It currently runs the parachains Tick, Trick and Track.

Rococo is an elaborate style of design and the name describes the painstaking effort that has gone into this project. Tick, Trick and Track are the German names for the cartoon ducks known to English speakers as Huey, Dewey and Louie.    

Connecting to Rococo parachain test network is preparing for linking to Polkadot mainnet.

## 2.  Status 

- [ ] This PBP is not implemented.

## 3. Requirements
Parami Protocol is to build a blockchain-empowered fair and transparent win-win private domain traffic advertising alliance, connecting the majority of advertisers, traffic owners and users, removing intermediaries, improving settlement efficiency, allowing users to take back their own digital sovereignty, and the revenue of all parties involved in digital advertising.  
  
Parami uses Substrate as the blockchain development framework, mainly for two reasons. From the technical level, Substrate framework is a general blockchain development framework launched by Polkadot.   

In order to connect rococo test network, the following three important elements are required:
1. Connected Parami CC2 to polkadot rococo parachain test network.
2. Add Parami logo and token symbol in rococo test parathreads.
3. Generate block and cross-chain to rococo test network.
